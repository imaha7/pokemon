## Project Assignment

## Web Platform Engineers - Sprout Digital Labs

Requirements:

1. Build a web app using React.js (allowed to use Create React App, Create Next
   App, or your own starter template) that has 3 pages, Pokemon List, Pokemon
   Detail, and My Pokemon List. Your web app UI/UX should be mobile-first &
   single page application (SPA) and follow requirements listed below.
2. You can use Rest-API from https://pokeapi.co/ as your data source.
3. Pokemon List page; should show a list of Pokemons’ names and the owned
   total. When a Pokemon is clicked, it should go to that Pokemon Detail page.
4. Pokemon Detail page; should show a picture of the Pokemon with its moves
   and types (this information is from the API, feel free to add more information
   on the Pokemon if you want to). The mandatory thing is that there should be
   a button to catch the Pokemon, (success probability is 50%), if success then
   the user can give the Pokemon a nickname and add that Pokemon to `My
   Pokemon List’. You can catch the same pokemon multiple times but need to
   give a different nickname for each pokemon.
5. My Pokemon List page; should show a list (like Pokemon List page, but with
   each of their nicknames as well) of all Pokemons you have caught. It should
   also be possible to remove/release a Pokemon from the list on this page. The
   pokemons in this list persist even after a full page reload.
6. Make your web-app as performant as possible. You can use tools such as
   Lighthouse to help you audit your web-app.
7. Kindly provide hosted project repository (can be GitHub, GitLab, or
   Bitbucket) and deployed web-app (you can use free platform solutions such
   as Vercel, Surge, Github Pages, Firebase, Netlify or other)

## Notes:

Npm version should be around at 14.19.0 LTS version if there was any error on trying to run npm commands like npm install, or npm start.
